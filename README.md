# MiSTer_SNAC2IEC
Inspired from the [SNAC Accessory Converter](https://github.com/blue212/SNAC) and the IEC Support of the C64 Core  
I created together with dtimber this little Adapter PCB for the MiSTer FPGA.  
  
The Adapter converts the MiSTer FPGA User Port (Serial IO) into a Commodore IEC/CBM (Serial) Bus Port.    
Use the Adapter to connect a real Commodore Floppy 1541 or compatible devices (SD2IEC/PI1541) to your MiSTer.  
  
I know there are better and faster ways to load a game into a MiSTer's Core, but this is fun üöÄ.  
  
### Compatible & Tested Cores:  
[**C64 Core**](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/C64_MiSTer) tested with [SD2IEC](https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/SD2IEC) and [PI1541](https://cbm-pi1541.firebaseapp.com/). I love it üòè  
  
### Let's go and have fun...
I used breakout Parts for the used Voltage-Level-Shifter and the Voltage-Regulator as I had them in stock.  
But there is also a Full-SMD-Version available, created by dtimber who created the Case as well.  
  
The PCB's

The first Picture shows the "Breakout Version", the second the "Full-SMD Version".
  
The Case was designed to look like the C64 Power Supply

Connector View

Left Connector = IEC/CBM Bus, right Connector = 5V Power from SNAC Port  
                                                     
All parts (Breakout Version)

Parts List:  
* The PCB
* USB 3.x Male Connector 
* 4-Channel Level Shifter (5V/3.3V)
* 5V to 3.3V Voltage Regulator
* IEC 6-Pin Female Connector
* Power Connector (5.5mm/2.1mm)
  
Soldered PCB Version **with** Level Shifter.  
For the Standard IO Board with SNAC Port and **3.3V** Signal Level.  
<img src="https://github.com/venice1200/MiSTer_SNAC2IEC/blob/main/Pictures/Complete_with_Levelshifter.jpg" width="400" class="center" />  
You need all parts.
  
Soldered PCB Version **without** Level Shifter.  
For the SNAC Port with integrated Level Shifter and **5V** Signal Level.  
<img src="https://github.com/venice1200/MiSTer_SNAC2IEC/blob/main/Pictures/Complete_no_Levelshifter.jpg" width="400" class="center" />  
Just add some 0R 0805 Resistors or a blob of solder to R1,R2,R3 and R4.  

A look inside...
