# MiSTer_SNAC2IEC
Inspired from the [SNAC Accessory Converter](https://github.com/blue212/SNAC) and the IEC Support of the C64 Core  
I created together with dtimber this little Adapter PCB for the MiSTer FPGA.  
  
The Adapter converts the MiSTer FPGA User Port (Serial IO) into a Commodore IEC/CBM (Serial) Bus Port.    
Use the Adapter to connect a real Commodore Floppy 1541 or compatible devices (SD2IEC/PI1541) to your MiSTer.  
  
I know there are better and faster ways to load a game into a MiSTer's Core, but this is fun ðŸš€.  
  
### Compatible & Tested Cores  
C64, C128, Commodore Plus/4  
### Tested Hardware  
[SD2IEC](https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/SD2IEC), [PI1541](https://cbm-pi1541.firebaseapp.com/), CBM 1541, CBM1541-II and CBM 1571.  
  
Core and Hardware also tested with **JiffyDos** ðŸš€.  
  
Double check the User Video below.   
  
### Let's go and have fun...
I used "breakout Parts" for the used Voltage-Levelshifter and the Voltage-Regulator as I had them in stock.  
There is also a Full-SMD-Version available, created by dtimber who created the Case as well.  
  
## PCB's
### First Versions  
### Breakout v1.1/SMD v1.0
The first Picture shows the "Breakout Version", the second the "Full-SMD Version".

### Updated Version(s)  
### Breakout v1.2  
Changes:
  * Added support for the SRQ Signal which is needed by the C128 Core for **Fast Serial Mode**.  
    The Breakout Version v1.2 need a second Leveshifter **on Top** of the first one to support the SRQ Signal.  
    Solder two small cables from the Pins LV5 and HV5 to one channel of the second Levelshifter.  
  * Removed 5V support (R1-R4) which need a Standard SNAC Adapter connected before SNAC2IEC.

## More Pictures
The Case was designed to look like the C64 Power Supply

Connector View  
<img src="https://github.com/venice1200/MiSTer_SNAC2IEC/blob/main/Pictures/Connector_Side.jpg" width="400" class="center" />  
Left Connector = IEC/CBM Bus, right Connector = 5V Power from SNAC Port  
                                                     
Soldered PCB Version **with** Level Shifter.  
Use it with the Standard IO Board with SNAC Port and **3.3V** Signal Level.  
<img src="https://github.com/venice1200/MiSTer_SNAC2IEC/blob/main/Pictures/Complete_with_Levelshifter.jpg" width="400" class="center" />  
You need all parts except the "optional's".
  
Soldered PCB Version **without** Level Shifter.  
Only usable with the "first" PCB Versions.  
Use it with SNAC Port's with integrated Level Shifter or with blue212's external SNAC Adapter and **5V** Signal Level.  
<img src="https://github.com/venice1200/MiSTer_SNAC2IEC/blob/main/Pictures/Complete_no_Levelshifter.jpg" width="400" class="center" />  
Just add some 0R 0805 Resistors or a blob of solder to R1,R2,R3 and R4.  

A look inside...
